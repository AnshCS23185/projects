      <h3 style="text-align: center;">The Fuel-Efficient Thruster Engine</h3>
      <br>
      
        <p>
            Mansory Design & Holding GmbH is proud to announce its collaboration with International Inventor, Dip.-Ing Mohsen Bahmani, in ushering in a new era of transportation. Together, they have developed an advanced thruster engine that promises to redefine the landscape of aerial vehicles. This pioneering patented technology boasts exceptional efficiency while maintaining a remarkably compact footprint, outperforming existing thrust engines.
In an era marked by emerging passenger and cargo drone technology, the cutting-edge thruster engine developed by Mansory and Dip.-Ing Mohsen Bahmani holds the key to shaping the future of aerial vehicles. With its unparalleled efficiency and compact design, it has the potential to expand the possibilities for flying vehicles, ensuring their seamless integration into the transportation landscape.

This remarkable invention has not only earned a well-deserved patent but has also received the approval of esteemed university professors. Mansory is fully committed to achieving this milestone, driven by the expertise of its exceptional technicians and engineers. Together, they are propelling transportation into a brighter, more efficient future.

While the future of drones holds great promise, there are significant challenges to overcome. Most drones rely on lithium-ion batteries, which deplete quickly due to the high current required for rotating propeller blades. Additionally, the time required for recharging is a limitation. Although petrol or diesel engines can generate electricity, they make drones heavy and noisy, making them unsuitable for widespread adoption.

Another crucial issue is the size, especially the width of drones, including passenger drones. Their large size and wingspan make it challenging to find suitable landing and take-off spaces in urban environments.

To address these challenges and create a lucrative future for drones, the granted fuel-efficient thrust-generating method offers an ideal solution. This innovation enables drones to fly twice as long with the same batteries, significantly extending their flight time. Even with advancements in battery technology, this invention still provides double the flight time compared to conventional propeller blade drones.

This invention comprises multiple small reaction engines running along a looped track to generate thrust. By replacing propeller blades with these thruster engines, the size of drones, especially their width, can be significantly reduced. This offers a significant advantage, as drones equipped with this patented thrust engine can land and take off in tight city spaces, ensuring that they can operate efficiently in urban environments.

Consider scenarios like ambulance drones that need to rescue individuals in tight city spaces where conventional flying cars face limitations. This innovation opens up new possibilities for seamless operations in such environments.
